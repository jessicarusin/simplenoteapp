s is a very simple version of the notes application.

I used the Eclipse IDE to develop this. I was able to test it using the emulator.  Please feel free to try to run the app through eclipse. 
It is a simple interface that allows the user to enter a note and save it.  It has a simple UI that calls a Node.JS rest server and stores the data in a MongoDB.
I have a backend RestAPI running on my own EC2 instance.  To test it feel free to go to http://54.235.108.219/notes/1


Some thoughts on Incomplete Items or areas of focus given more time:

1. Exception handling is not complete yet  
2. Validating user input would have to be more robust
3. I was thinking that it would be good to check network connectivity and if it was not available to either alert the user or use a 
local storage method and push the data when the connectivity comes back
4. Unit testing is not complete.  I am reading about how to test the activities and have started an Android test project.  Still working on this...
5. Security has not been implemented
6. Storing more parameters with the note such as a timestamp, etc.
7. Ability to edit and delete notes
